function [dataPeaks] = forceTransAnalysis(targetNotebook, targetPage, mode)
    %% Description: Get force and frequency data on a ft experiment. Pair with plotHeartAnalysis.m
    % to plot out figures from output (dataPeaks)

    % Inputs:
        % targetNotebook (int)
        % targetPage (int)
        % mode (str) - either "heart" or "muscle"

    % Output:
        % dataPeaks (struct) - struct with the following fields
            % amp - amplitude of every peak detected on files listed in metadata
            % freq - instantaneous frequency of every peaks
            % file - associated file number in the sequence --> fix
            % temp - avg temp between a peak and the next one (in Celsius)
            % time - time of each peak
